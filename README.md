# Imagem View
 "Imagem View" is a program written in c/c++ to read and 
display images of Independent JPEG Group's JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg),
Portable Network Graphics (.png), PiCture eXchange (.pcx), 
True Vision Targa (.tga) and a subset (ASCII text) of NetPBM 
files (.pbm, .pnm, .pgm, .ppm, .pam).
 The first program is "Targa View", a very simple and small 
program to load Targa Image Files, but I added others format 
and the name tuned urong for the actual purpose.
